# 300 - Version

For core integrations, this should be omitted.

As ```Agility Game``` is not a core (as in part of the core of Home Assistant) integration, we do require a version.

The version of the integration is required for custom integrations. The version needs to be a valid version recognized by [AwesomeVersion](https://github.com/ludeeus/awesomeversion) like [CalVer](https://calver.org/) or [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
