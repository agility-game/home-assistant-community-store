# 200 - Creating your first integration

Alright, so it's time to write your first code for your integration. AWESOME. Don't worry, we've tried hard to keep it as easy as possible. From a Home Assistant development environment, type the following and follow the instructions:

```
$ python3 -m script.scaffold integration
```

This will set you up with everything that you need to build an integration that is able to be set up via the user interface. More extensive examples of integrations are available from [our example repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/example-custom-config/tree/master/custom_components/).
