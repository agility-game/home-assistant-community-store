# 100 - Domain

The domain is a short name consisting of characters and underscores. This domain has to be unique and cannot be changed. Example of the domain for the mobile app integration: ```mobile_app```. The domain key has to match the directory this file is in.

In our case our domain would be ```agility_game```.
